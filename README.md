# web_scraping_challenge

In this assignment, I will build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. 

# Process: Scraping

I create a Jupyter Notebook file called mission_to_mars.ipynb. I use this file to complete all your scraping and analysis tasks. 

After reading the news, I explored the latest Mars art and learned a few facts that everyone should know using https://spaceimages-mars.com and https://galaxyfacts-mars.com!

Finally, we received a geology lesson from https://marshemispheres.com/ and got those views of all the hemispheres of Mars!
